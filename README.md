"Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing"

This Python script calculates and compares the performance of moving average and exponential smoothing 
techniques for forecasting demand values. It includes functionalities such as:

-Retrieval of demand values either from a CSV file or manual input.

-Calculation of moving averages and corresponding error metrics.

-Exponential smoothing forecasting with error analysis.

-Visualization of moving average and exponential smoothing plots.



"Usage"

-Run the script.

-Follow the prompts to import demand values or input them manually.

-Provide the window size and alpha value for smoothing.

-View output tables and metrics for both methods.

-Analyze moving average and exponential smoothing plots.


"Dependencies"

-Python 3.x

-matplotlib for plotting

-tabulate for tabular output


"How to Run"

-Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed.

-Clone the repository or download the script.

-Run the script using python script_name.py.

-Follow the prompts and input necessary values.

-Analyze the output tables and plots to understand forecast performance.


"Note"

-Ensure demand values are provided in chronological order.

-Adjust window size and alpha value according to data characteristics.
